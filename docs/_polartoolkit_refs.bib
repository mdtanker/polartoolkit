  abstract = {Since 2007/2008, seismographs were deployed in many new locations across much of Antarctica. Using the records from 122 broadband seismic stations, over 10,000 Rayleigh wave fundamental-mode dispersion curves have been retrieved from earthquake waveforms and from ambient noise. Using the processed data set, a 3-D S-velocity model for the Antarctic lithosphere was constructed using a single-step surface wave tomographic method, and a Moho depth map was estimated from the model. Using the derived crustal thicknesses, the average ratio of lithospheric mantle and crustal densities of Antarctica was calculated. The calculated density ratio indicates that the average crustal density for Antarctica is much higher than the average values for continental crust or the average density of lithospheric mantle is so low as to be equal to low-density bound of Archean lithosphere. The latter implies that the lithospheric mantle in much of Antarctica should be old and of Archean age. The East Antarctic Mountain Ranges (EAMOR) represent a thick crustal belt, with the thickest crust (\textasciitilde 60 km) located close to Dome A. Very high velocities can be found at depths greater than 200 km beneath parts of East Antarctica, demonstrating that the continental lithosphere extends deeper than 200 km. The very thick crust beneath the EAMOR may represent the collision suture of East Gondwana with Indo-Antarctica and West Gondwana during the Pan-African orogeny.},

  abstract = {We estimate the upper mantle temperature of the Antarctic Plate based on the thermoelastic properties of mantle minerals and S velocities using a new 3-D shear velocity model, AN1-S. Crustal temperatures and surface heat fluxes are then calculated from the upper mantle temperature assuming steady state thermal conduction. The temperature at the top of the asthenosphere beneath the oceanic region and West Antarctica is higher than the dry mantle solidus, indicating the presence of melt. From the temperature values, we generate depth maps of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and the Curie temperature isotherm. The maps show that East Antarctica has a thick lithosphere similar to that of other stable cratons, with the thickest lithosphere (\textasciitilde 250 km) between Domes A and C. The thin crust and lithosphere beneath West Antarctica are similar to those of modern subduction-related rift systems in East Asia. A cold region beneath the Antarctic Peninsula is similar in spatial extent to that of a flat-subducted slab beneath the southern Andes, indicating a possible remnant of the Phoenix Plate, which was subducted prior to 10 Ma. The oceanic lithosphere generally thickens with increasing age, and the age-thickness correlation depends on the spreading rate of the ridge that formed the lithosphere. Significant flattening of the age-thickness curves is not observed for the mature oceanic lithosphere of the Antarctic Plate.},

  abstract = {We compile existing seismic, gravity, radar and magnetic data, together with the subglacial bedrock relief from the BEDMACHINE project, to build the most detailed sediment model for Antarctica. We interpolate these data according to a tectonic map of Antarctica using a statistical kriging method. Our results reveal significant sediment accumulation in Antarctica with several types of sedimentary basins: parts of the Beacon Supergroup and more recent rifting basins. The basement relief closely resembles major geological and tectonic structures. The thickness of sediments has significant variations around the continent, and depends on the degree of crustal extension. West Antarctica has wide sedimentary basins: the Ross basin (thickness 2--6 km), the Filchner-Ronne basin (2--12 km) with continuations into East Antarctica, the Bentley Subglacial Trench and the Byrd basin (2--4 km). The deepest Filchner-Ronne basin has a complex structure with multi-layered sediments. East Antarctica is characterized by vast sedimentary basins such as the Pensacola-Pole (1--2 km), Coats Land (1--3 km), Dronning Maud Land (1--2 km), Vostok (2--7 km), Aurora (1--3 km), Astrolabe (2--4 km), Adventure (2--4 km), and Wilkes (1--4 km) basins, along with narrow deep rifts filled by sediments: JutulStraumen (1--2 km), Lambert (2--5 km), Scott, Denman, Vanderford and Totten (2--4 km) rifts. The average thickness of sediments for the whole continent is about 0.77 km. The new model, ANTASed, represents a significant improvement over CRUST 1.0 for Antarctica, and reveals new sedimentary basins. Differences between ANTASed and CRUST 1.0 reach +12/-3 km.},

It is constructed from nearly 1100 individually selected Landsat-7 ETM+ scenes.

Mosaicing to avoid clouds produced a high quality, nearly cloud-free benchmark data set of Antarctica for the International Polar Year from images collected primarily during 1999--2003. Multiple color composites and enhancements were generated to illustrate additional characteristics of the multispectral data including: the true appearance of the surface; discrimination between snow and bare ice; reflectance variations within bright snow; recovered reflectance values in regions of sensor saturation; and subtle topographic variations associated with ice flow. LIMA is viewable and individual scenes or user defined portions of the mosaic are downloadable at http://lima.usgs.gov.

However, GHF remains poorly constrained, with few and sparse local, borehole-derived estimates, and large discrepancies in the magnitude and distribution of existing continent-scale estimates from geophysical models. We review the methods to extract GHF, compile borehole and probe-derived estimates from measured temperature profiles, and recommend the following future directions: 1) Obtain more borehole-derived estimates from the subglacial bedrock and englacial temperature profiles. 2) Estimate GHF beneath the interior of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (the region most sensitive to GHF variation) via long-wavelength microwave emissivity. 3) Estimate GHF from inverse glaciological modelling, constrained by evidence for basal melting. 4) Revise geophysically-derived GHF estimates using a combination of Curie depth, seismic, and thermal isostasy models. 5) Integrate in these geophysical approaches a more accurate model of the structure and distribution of heat production elements within the crust, and considering heterogeneities in the underlying mantle. And 6) continue international interdisciplinary communication and data access.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Our group captured existing geological map data into a geographic information system (GIS), refined its spatial reliability, harmonised classification, and improved representation of glacial sequences and geomorphology, thereby creating a comprehensive and coherent representation of Antarctic geology. A total of 99,080 polygons were unified for depicting geology at 1:250,000 scale, but locally there are some areas with higher spatial resolution. Geological unit definition is based on a mixed chronostratigraphic- and lithostratigraphic-based classification. Description of rock and moraine polygons employs the international Geoscience Markup Language (GeoSciML) data protocols to provide attribute-rich and queryable information, including bibliographic links to 589 source maps and scientific literature. GeoMAP is the first detailed geological map dataset covering all of Antarctica. It depicts `known geology' of rock exposures rather than `interpreted' sub-ice features and is suitable for continent-wide perspectives and cross-discipline interrogation.},

Since 2013, the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) has represented the most comprehensive compilation of bathymetry for the Southern Ocean south of 60{$^\circ$}S. Recently, the IBCSO Project has combined its efforts with the Nippon Foundation -- GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project supporting the goal of mapping the world's oceans by 2030. New datasets initiated a second version of IBCSO (IBCSO v2). This version extends to 50{$^\circ$}S (covering approximately 2.4 times the area of seafloor of the previous version) including the gateways of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic circumpolar frontal systems. Due to increased (multibeam) data coverage, IBCSO v2 significantly improves the overall representation of the Southern Ocean seafloor and resolves many submarine landforms in more detail. This makes IBCSO v2 the most authoritative seafloor map of the area south of 50{$^\circ$}S.},

  abstract = {Over the past 60 years, scientists have strived to understand the past, present and future of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. One of the key components of this research has been the mapping of Antarctic bed topography and ice thickness parameters that are crucial for modelling ice flow and hence for predicting future ice loss and ensuing sea level rise. Supported by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), the Bedmap3 Action Group aims not only to produce new gridded maps of ice thickness and bed topography for the international scientific community, but also to standardize and make available all the geophysical survey data points used in producing the Bedmap gridded products. Here, we document the survey data used in the latest iteration, Bedmap3, incorporating and adding to all of the datasets previously used for Bedmap1 and Bedmap2, including ice-bed, surface and thickness point data from all Antarctic geophysical campaigns since the 1950s. More specifically, we describe the processes used to standardize and make these and future survey and gridded datasets accessible under the \&lsquo;Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable\&rsquo; (FAIR) data principles. With the goals to make the gridding process reproducible and to allow scientists to re-use the data freely for their own analysis, we introduce the new SCAR Bedmap Data Portal ({$<$}a href="bedmap.scar.org" target="\_blank" rel="noopener"{$>$}bedmap.scar.org{$<$}/a{$>$}, last access: 18 October 2022) created to provide unprecedented open access to these important datasets, through a user-friendly webmap interface. We believe that this data release will be a valuable asset to Antarctic research and will greatly extend the life cycle of the data held within it. Data are available from the UK Polar Data Centre: {$<$}a href="https://data.bas.ac.uk" target="\_blank" rel="noopener"{$>$}https://data.bas.ac.uk{$<$}/a{$>$}.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present Bedmap2, a new suite of gridded products describing surface elevation, ice-thickness and the seafloor and subglacial bed elevation of the Antarctic south of 60\textopenbullet{} S. We derived these products using data from a variety of sources, including many substantial surveys completed since the original Bedmap compilation (Bedmap1) in 2001. In particular, the Bedmap2 ice thickness grid is made from 25 million measurements, over two orders of magnitude more than were used in Bedmap1. In most parts of Antarctica the subglacial landscape is visible in much greater detail than was previously available and the improved datacoverage has in many areas revealed the full scale of mountain ranges, valleys, basins and troughs, only fragments of which were previously indicated in local surveys. The derived statistics for Bedmap2 show that the volume of ice contained in the Antarctic ice sheet (27 million km3) and its potential contribution to sea-level rise (58 m) are similar to those of Bedmap1, but the mean thickness of the ice sheet is 4.6 \% greater, the mean depth of the bed beneath the grounded ice sheet is 72 m lower and the area of ice sheet grounded on bed below sea level is increased by 10 \%. The Bedmap2 compilation highlights several areas beneath the ice sheet where the bed elevation is substantially lower than the deepest bed indicated by Bedmap1. These products, along with grids of data coverage and uncertainty, provide new opportunities for detailed modelling of the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.},

Some missing islands were added and glacier fronts were updated using 2017 satellite imagery. The dataset can be used for cartography, analysis and as a mask, amongst other uses. At very large scales, the data will appear angular due to the nature of being extracted from a raster with 150 m cell size, but the dataset should be suitable for use at most scales and can be edited by the user to exclude very small islands if required. The projection of the dataset is WGS 84 NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic North, EPSG 3413. The dataset does not promise to cover every island and coastlines were digitised using the data creator's interpretation of the landforms from the images.},

By the end of 2000, a 5 km grid of magnetic anomalies was produced for the entire region. The map readily portrays the first-order magnetic differences between oceanic and continental regions. The magnetic anomaly pattern over the continent reflects many phases of geological history whilst that over the abyssal plains of the surrounding oceans is dominated mostly by patterns of linear seafloor spreading anomalies and fracture zones. The Antarctic compilation reveals terranes of varying ages, including Proterozoic-Archaean cratons, Proterozoic-Palaeozoic mobile belts, Palaeozoic-Cenozoic magmatic arc systems and other important crustal features. The map delineates intra-continental rifts and major rifts along the Antarctic continental margin, the regional extent of plutons and volcanics, such as the Ferrar dolerites and Kirkpatrick basalts. The magnetic anomaly map of the Antarctic together with other geological and geophysical information provides new perspectives on the break-up of Gondwana and Rodinia evolution.},

  abstract = {High-quality maps of Geothermal heat flow (GHF) are crucial when modeling ice dynamics, shape, and mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is one of the largest potential contributors to sea level rise. The determination of GHF remains challenging, as in situ data are sparse and geophysical models exhibit large discrepancies in amplitude and resolution, especially on regional scales. Using a novel approach implementing a joint inversion of gravity and seismic tomography data with various geophysical and mineral physics information, we estimate the 3D thermal lithospheric structure and present a new GHF map. The resulting surface heat flow correlates with the location of subglacial volcanism and can represent a boundary condition for accurate ice dynamics models that can explain observed acceleration in the ongoing ice mass loss. Absolute values are within the range of other seismology-based methods and are much lower than those obtained using for example, magnetic data. High uncertainties remain in the parametrization of the upper crustal structure and thermal parameters.},

  abstract = {In Haeger et al. (2022), we created a three dimensional model of the temperature distribution and the geothermal heat flow of the Antarctic lithosphere as well as a new model of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). The models were obtained in a three-step approach: First, we calculate the initial temperature distribution in the upper mantle by iteratively combining seismic tomography (An et al., 2015; Schaeffer \&amp; Lebedev, 2013) and gravity data (F\"orste et al., 2014; Scheinert et al., 2016) considering composition and density variations self-consistently (Haeger et al., 2019). Second, we define the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in a thermal sense based on the resulting geotherm by assuming it corresponds to the 1300{$^\circ$}C isotherm. Third, we solve the steady-state heat equation to obtain the temperature distribution and the geothermal heat flow in the lithosphere. One crucial yet still largely unknown factor in the model is the parametrization of the crust. In order to overcome this, we calculated thermal models for a range of crustal properties that are described in detail in Haeger et al. (2022) and the related supplementary material. Here, we only share the conductive temperature and the geothermal heat flow model for the preferred model (n{$^\circ$} 29 in the supplementary) in binary netCDF files. Additionally, we present the depth to LAB and surface and mantle heat flow maps, the latter represents the heat flow at the depth of the Moho discontinuity (Haeger et al., 2019) as .txt ascii tables. As a measure of uncertainty of the preferred surface heat flow model, the standard deviation of all calculated models is additionally given. The models are presented in polar stereographic projections with true scale at 71{$^\circ$} South (Snyder, 1987) and span \textpm 3700 km with a 10 km spacing in x- and y-direction, respectively. For the netCDF files, the depth ranges from the bedrock surface (BedMachine, Morlighem et al., 2020) which is defined as the 0 level to the LAB in a 1 km spacing. The depths to the Moho and the LAB are given relative to sea level.},

  abstract = {Geothermal heat flow is a key parameter in governing ice dynamics, via its influence on basal melt and sliding, englacial rheology, and erosion. It is expected to exhibit significant lateral variability across Antarctica. Despite this, surface heat flow derived from Earth's interior remains one of the most poorly constrained parameters controlling ice sheet evolution. To obtain a continent-wide map of Antarctic heat supply at regional-scale resolution, we estimate upper mantle thermomechanical structure directly from VS. Until now, direct inferences of Antarctic heat supply have assumed constant crustal composition. Here, we explore a range of crustal conductivity and radiogenic heat production values by fitting thermodynamically self-consistent geotherms to their seismically inferred counterparts. Independent estimates of crustal conductivity derived from VP are integrated to break an observed trade-off between crustal parameters, allowing us to infer Antarctic geothermal heat flow and its associated uncertainty.},

The mosaic includes an error estimate and a time stamp, enabling change measurement. Typical elevation errors are less than 1\&thinsp;m, as validated by the comparison to airborne laser altimetry.

  abstract = {To resolve the bed elevation of Antarctica, we present DeepBedMap -- a novel machine learning method that can produce Antarctic bed topography with adequate surface roughness from multiple remote sensing data inputs. The super-resolution deep convolutional neural network model is trained on scattered regions in Antarctica where high-resolution (250 m) ground-truth bed elevation grids are available. This model is then used to generate high-resolution bed topography in less surveyed areas. DeepBedMap improves on previous interpolation methods by not restricting itself to a low-spatial-resolution (1000 m) BEDMAP2 raster image as its prior image. It takes in additional high-spatialresolution datasets, such as ice surface elevation, velocity and snow accumulation, to better inform the bed topography even in the absence of ice thickness data from direct icepenetrating-radar surveys. The DeepBedMap model is based on an adapted architecture of the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network, chosen to minimize perpixel elevation errors while producing realistic topography. The final product is a four-times-upsampled (250 m) bed elevation model of Antarctica that can be used by glaciologists interested in the subglacial terrain and by ice sheet modellers wanting to run catchment- or continent-scale ice sheet model simulations. We show that DeepBedMap offers a rougher topographic profile compared to the standard bicubically interpolated BEDMAP2 and BedMachine Antarctica and envision it being used where a high-resolution bed elevation model is required.},

By compiling old and new seismic data, we identify sequences representing preglacial, transitional, and full glacial deposition processes along the Pacific margin of West Antarctica. The preglacial sediment grid depicts 1.3--4.0 km thick depocenters, relatively evenly distributed along the margin. The depocenters change markedly in the transitional phase at, or after, the Eocene/Oligocene boundary when the first major ice sheets reached the shelf. Full glacial sequences, starting in the middle Miocene, indicate new depocenter formation North of the Amundsen Sea Embayment and localized eastward shifts in the Bellingshausen Sea and Antarctic Peninsula basins. Using present-day drainage paths and source areas on the continent, our calculations indicate that an estimated observed total sedimentary volume of  10 3 106 km3 was eroded from West Antarctica since the separation of New Zealand in the Late Cretaceous. Of this, 4.9 3 106 km3 predates the onset of glaciation and need to be considered for a 34 Ma paleotopography reconstruction. Whereas 5.1 3 106 km3 postdates the onset of glaciation, of which 2.5 3 106 km3 were deposited in post mid-Miocene full glacial conditions.},

The adopted approach estimates GHF from multiple geophysical and geological data sets, assuming that GHF is substantially related to the geodynamic setting of the plates. We apply a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree algorithm to find an optimal prediction model relating GHF to the observables. The geophysical and geological features are primarily global data sets, which are often unreliable in polar regions due to limited data coverage. Quality and reliability of the data sets are reviewed and discussed in line with the estimated GHF model. Predictions for Australia, where an extensive database of GHF measurements exists, demonstrate the validity of the approach. In Antarctica, only a sparse number of direct GHF measurements are available. Therefore, we explore the use of regional data sets of Antarctica and its tectonic Gondwana neighbors to refine the predictions. With this, we demonstrate the need for adding reliable data to the machine learning approach. Finally, we present a new geothermal heat flow map, which exhibits intermediate values compared to previous models, ranging from 35 to 156 mW/m2, and visible connections to the conjugate margins in Australia, Africa, and India.},

From these data, a seamless suite of digital topographic models have been compiled for Antarctica and its surrounding ocean. This includes grids of ice sheet thickness over the grounded ice sheet and ice shelves, water column thickness beneath the floating ice shelves, bed elevation beneath the grounded ice sheet, and bathymetry to 60{$^\circ$}S, including the sub-ice-shelf cavities. These grids are consistent with a recent high-resolution surface elevation model of Antarctica. While the digital models have a nominal spatial resolution of 5 km, such high resolution is justified by the original data density only over a few parts of the ice sheet. The suite does, however, provide an unparalleled vision of the geosphere beneath the ice sheet and a more reliable basis for ice sheet modeling than earlier maps. The total volume of the Antarctic ice sheet calculated from the BEDMAP grid is 25.4 million km3, and the total sea level equivalent, derived from the amount of ice contained within the grounded ice sheet, is 57 m, comprising 52 m from the East Antarctic ice sheet and 5 m from the West Antarctic ice sheet, slightly less than earlier estimates.

  abstract = {Surface ice velocity is a fundamental characteristic of glaciers and ice sheets that quantifies the transport of ice. Changes in ice dynamics have a major impact on ice sheet mass balance and its contribution to sea level rise. Prior comprehensive mappings employed speckle and feature tracking techniques, optimized for fast-flow areas, with precision of 2-5 m/year, hence limiting our ability to describe ice flow in the slow interior. We present a vector map of ice velocity using the interferometric phase from multiple satellite synthetic aperture radars resulting in 10 times higher precision in speed (20 cm/year) and direction (5{$^\circ$}) over 80\% of Antarctica. Precision mapping over areas of slow motion ({$<$}1 m/year) improves from 20 to 93\%, which helps better constrain drainage boundaries, improve mass balance assessment, evaluate regional atmospheric climate models, reconstruct ice thickness, and inform ice sheet numerical models. Plain Language Summary We present a new map of Antarctic ice velocity that is 10 times more precise than prior maps and reveals ice motion at a high precision over 80\% of the continent versus 20\% in the past. The ice motion vector map provides novel constrains on interior ice motion and its connection with the glaciers and ice stream that control the stability and mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.},

  abstract = {The lithospheric structure of Antarctica is still underexplored. Moho depth estimate studies are in disagreement by more than 10 km in several regions, including, for example, the hinterland of the Transantarctic Mountains. Taking account the sparseness of seismological stations and the nonuniqueness of potential field methods, inversions of Moho depth are performed here based on satellite gravity data in combination with currently available seismically constrained Moho depth estimates. Our results confirm that a lower density contrast at the Moho is present under East Antarctica than beneath West Antarctica. A comparison between the Moho depth derived from our inversion and an Airy-isostatic Moho model also reveals a spatially variable buoyancy contribution from the lithospheric mantle beneath contrasting sectors of East Antarctica. Finally, to test the plausibility of different Moho depths scenarios for the Transantarctic Mountains-Wilkes Subglacial Basin system, we present 2-D lithospheric models along the Trans-Antarctic Mountain Seismic Experiment/Gamburtsev Mountain Seismic experiment seismic profile. Our models show that if a moderately depleted lithospheric mantle of inferred Proterozoic age underlies the region, then a shallower Moho is more likely beneath the Wilkes Subglacial Basin. If however, refertilization processes occurred in the upper mantle, for example, in response to Ross-age subduction, then a deeper Moho scenario is preferred. We conclude that 3-D lithospheric modeling, coupled with the availability of new seismic information in the hinterland of the Transantarctic Mountains, is required to help resolve this controversy, thereby also reducing the ambiguities in geothermal heat flux estimation beneath this key part of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Plain Language Summary Antarctica is a vast and remote continent that is mostly buried beneath the largest ice sheets left on Earth. Consequently, its deep structure is still poorly known, despite its importance as the cradle on which the overlying ice sheets flow. By studying anomalies in the gravitational field of the Earth as measured by satellites and using independent constraints derived by measuring seismic wave travel times from distant earthquakes, we investigate the variations in the depth of the boundary between Earth's crust and mantle (known as the Moho) beneath Antarctica. Our models confirm that the older cratonic regions of East Antarctica have generally deeper Moho compared to the younger geological provinces of West Antarctica. They also highlight that large regions of East Antarctica may exhibit contrasting mantle characteristics, and this lends further weight to recent geological and geophysical studies, indicating that East Antarctica is composed of different Precambrian provinces. In our study we re-evaluated in particular two Moho depth scenarios derived from previous seismic studies for the hinterland of the Transantarctic Mountains, where the enigmatic Wilkes Subglacial Basin lies. We show that if an old Precambrian mantle is assumed, then a thin crust scenario beneath the basin is more likely, but if the mantle has been in part modified by more recent (ca. 500 Ma old) subduction, then a thicker crust scenario would become more viable. Overall, our study calls for combining gravity, seismological, and petrological modeling for enhanced Antarctic lithosphere and isostatic studies.},

  abstract = {We present digital image mosaics of surface morphology and optical snow grain size for the Antarctic continent and surrounding islands, assembled from 260 Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The products are derived from MODIS band 1 (red light: {$\sim$} 647 nm) and band 2 (infrared: {$\sim$} 857 nm) orbit swath data acquired during the 2003--2004 austral summer. Multiple images of all areas are combined in a data cumulation scheme to improve spatial resolution and increase radiometric content of the mosaics. The component images were de-striped, geo-registered, and re-sampled to the projection grid using the MODIS Swath-to-Grid Toolbox (MS2GT) software. A 125 m groundequivalent polar stereographic projection was used, identical to previous radar image mosaics and similar to several other continent-wide data sets. Geo-location accuracy of the final mosaics is better than 125 m. Swath acquisition times were limited to the range 05:00--13:30 UT to provide broad but uniform mosaic illumination. Regions of cloud cover, blowing snow, and intense forward scattering were masked prior to compositing. The MOA snow grain size data set image provides the first continent-wide semi-quantitative map of mean summer snow, firn, and blue ice grain size. Optical grain size (radius) was determined using a normalized difference index derived from MODIS band 1 and band 2 rad values. Atmospheric correction, adjustments for directional reflectance variation and snow grain size estimation were accomplished by a look-up table, generated by a combination of published models of snow spectral reflectance and atmosphere radiative transfer. Validation of the snow grain size image is provided by in situ spectra of snow-covered sea ice made in October, 2003. We use the new data sets to determine major ice shelf areas, and shelf edge, coastline, and ice grounding line vector files, and determine areas of selected blue ice regions. These data sets are available for download at http://nsidc.org/data/moa/.},

Ambient noise tomography exploiting data from more than 200 seismic stations deployed over the past 18 years is used to construct Rayleigh wave phase and group velocity dispersion maps. Comparison between the ambient noise phase velocity maps with those constructed using teleseismic earthquakes confirms the accuracy of both results. These maps, together with P receiver function waveforms, are used to construct a new 3-D shear velocity (Vs) model for the crust and uppermost mantle using a Bayesian Monte Carlo algorithm. The new 3-D seismic model shows the dichotomy of the tectonically active West Antarctica (WANT) and the stable and ancient East Antarctica (EANT). In WANT, the model exhibits a slow uppermost mantle along the Transantarctic Mountains (TAMs) front, interpreted as the thermal effect from Cenozoic rifting. Beneath the southern TAMs, the slow uppermost mantle extends horizontally beneath the traditionally recognized EANT, hypothesized to be associated with lithospheric delamination. Thin crust and lithosphere observed along the Amundsen Sea coast and extending into the interior suggest involvement of these areas in Cenozoic rifting. EANT, with its relatively thick and cold crust and lithosphere marked by high Vs, displays a slower Vs anomaly beneath the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in the uppermost mantle, which we hypothesize may be the signature of a compositionally anomalous body, perhaps remnant from a continental collision.},

New features in this map include high GHF in the southern Transantarctic Mountains where warmer uppermost mantle is introduced by lithospheric removal and in the Thwaites Glacier region.

Active areas of interest include the effect of the heterogeneous Earth structure on glacial isostatic adjustment, the distribution of geothermal heat, and the history of erosion and deposition. In response to this research need, we construct an adaptable and updatable 3D grid model in a software framework to contain and process solid Earth data. The computational framework, based on an open source software package agrid, allows different data sources to be combined and jointly analyzed. The grid model is populated with crustal properties from geological observations and geochronology results, where such data exist, and published segmentation from geophysical data in the interior where direct observations are absent. The grid also contains 3D geophysical data such as wave speed and derived temperature from seismic tomographic models, and 2D datasets such as gravity anomalies, surface elevation, subglacial temperature, and ice sheet boundaries. We demonstrate the usage of the framework by computing new estimates of subglacial steady-state heat flow in a continental scale model for east Antarctica and a regional scale model for the Wilkes Basin in Victoria Land. We hope that the 3D model and framework will be used widely across the solid Earth and cryosphere research communities.},

The map is generated using a similarity detection approach by attributing observables from geophysics and geology to a large number of high-quality heat flow values (N = 5,792) from other continents. Observables from global, continental, and regional datasets for Antarctica are used with a weighting function that allows the degree of similarity to increase with proximity and how similar the observables are. The similarity detection parameters are optimized through cross correlation. For each grid cell in Antarctica, a weighted average heat flow value and uncertainty metrics are calculated. The Aq1 model provides higher spatial resolution in comparison to previous results. High heat flow is shown in the Thwaites Glacier region, with local values over 150 mW m-2. We also map elevated values over 80 mW m-2 in Palmer Land, Marie Byrd Land, Victoria Land and Queen Mary Land. Very low heat flow is shown in the interior of Wilkes Land and Coats Land, with values under 40 mW m-2. We anticipate that the new geothermal heat flow map, Aq1, and its uncertainty bounds will find extended use in providing boundary conditions for ice sheet modeling and understanding the interactions between the cryosphere and solid Earth.

GlobSed covers a larger area than previously published global grids and incorporates updates for the NE Atlantic, Arctic, Southern Ocean, and Mediterranean regions, which results in a 29.7\% increase in estimated total oceanic sediment volume. We use this new global grid and a revised global oceanic lithospheric age grid to assess the relationship between the total sediment thickness and age of the underlying oceanic lithosphere and its latitude. An analytical approximation model is used to mathematically describe sedimentation trends in major oceanic basins and to allow paleobathymetric reconstructions at any given geological time. This study provides a much-needed update of the sediment thickness distribution of the world oceans and delivers a model for sedimentation rates on oceanic crust through time that agrees well with selected drill data used for comparison. Plain Language Summary We have constructed a new global ocean sediment thickness map, GlobSed, from previously published maps and new data compiled in this study. GlobSed is used together with a new map of lithospheric ages developed for this study to analyze how sediment thickness changes with respect to the age of the underlying oceanic crust and latitude. The results show a clear age-latitude dependence where sediment thickness increases with age of the oceanic crust, toward high southern and northern latitudes and toward the equator. In addition, we calculate the total volume of sediments in the oceans, which shows an increase of 29.7\%, compared to previously published global maps. Further, we develop a mathematical formula for sediment thickness as a function of age and latitude that describes the sediment thickness pattern in the oceans within reasonable error, and we suggest that this is a good approximation for estimating sediment thickness in oceanic basins through time.},

  abstract = {New geophysical data from Antarctica's Ross Embayment reveal the structure and subglacial geology of extended continental crust beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. We use airborne magnetic data from the ROSETTA-Ice Project to locate the contact between magnetic basement and overlying sediments. We delineate a broad, segmented basement high with thin (0--500m) non-magnetic sedimentary cover which trends northward into the Ross Sea's Central High. Before subsiding in the Oligocene, this feature likely facilitated early glaciation in the region and subsequently acted as a pinning point and ice flow divide. Flanking the high are wide sedimentary basins, up to 3700m deep, which parallel the Ross Sea basins and likely formed during Cretaceous-Neogene intracontinental extension. NW-SE basins beneath the Siple Coast grounding zone, by contrast, are narrow, deep, and elongate. They suggest tectonic divergence upon active faults that may localize geothermal heat and/or groundwater flow, both important components of the subglacial system.},

Please cite the original authors when using this dataset. Changes made: Convert the grid from the ASCII format of ICGEM to CF-compliant netCDF. Add relevant metadata, including names, units, datum, etc. Fix grid coordinates to be generated by numpy.linspace instead numpy.arange (or the equivalent used by ICGEM internally) to guarantee equal spacing to a higher accuracy.

  abstract = {Scientific software is usually created to acquire, analyze, model, and visualize data. As such, many software libraries include sample datasets in their distributions for use in documentation, tests, benchmarks, and workshops. A common approach is to include smaller datasets in the GitHub repository directly and package them with the source and binary distributions (e.g., scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and scikit-image (Van der Walt et al., 2014) do this). As data files increase in size, it becomes unfeasible to store them in GitHub repositories. Thus, larger datasets require writing code to download the files from a remote server to the user's computer. The same problem is faced by scientists using version control to manage their research projects. While downloading a data file over HTTPS can be done easily with modern Python libraries, it is not trivial to manage a set of files, keep them updated, and check for corruption. For example, scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), Cartopy (Met Office, n.d.), and PyVista (Sullivan \& Kaszynski, 2019) all include code dedicated to this particular task. Instead of scientists and library authors recreating the same code, it would be best to have a minimalistic and easy to set up tool for fetching and maintaining data files.},
